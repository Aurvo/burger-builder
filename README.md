This project is currently a work in progress. It is the main project of Udemy's 'React 16 
- The Complete Guide (incl. React Router 4 & Redux)' course that I'm making along with the 
instructor (with some personal adjustments) in order to better understand React. While I 
did not make this by myself, I still believe it demonstrates a considerable understanding 
of React and general web development related knowledge.

Bbootstrapped with Create React App.
